function out = seamlessCloning(target, source, mask)
% SEAMLESSCLONING copy-and-pastes the gradient of a source image onto a
% target image using a poisson solver. 
%   @param target color image (3 channels). The gradient fields of the source
%          image are pasted onto this image. Fields, since there are many
%          color channels which form a gradient field.
%   @param source color image (3 channels). This image's gradient fields
%   are pasted onto the target field.
%   @param mask acts as the boundary condition selector. Thus, this image 
%          determines which pixels are copy-pasted onto the target image.
%   @return out image with adjusted gradient field according to
%   description.
