%GRADIENTMIXING Perform gradient mixing: Combine properties the properties
%of a given images on top of another image (for example add details to a
%texture).
%   We assume that all given images are of the same dimensionality.
%   @param target is background image (3 color channels)
%          on top of this image the gradient will be plotted.
%   @param source is supposed to be an image representing some detailed
%          that should be mixed on top of the given target image.
%   @param mask boundary condition: border is one, rest is zero.
%   @return out image with adjusted gradient field according to
%   description.
